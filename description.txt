IMPORTANT NOTES: THIS IS A BETA, THE MOD IS MULTIPLAYER INCOMPATIBLE, WITH A HIGH CHANCE OF BUGS AND ERRORS.

Polarities is finally in 1.4.4, and wanted to take a quick moment to address concerns, mostly about why the mod would get an update in such a broken state. Its simply because of Polarities development history, it was taken over by me Arc, for porting and I am not an expert coder. I'm experienced but not perfect, and Polarities is a complex mod many complex systems I tried to port I couldn't fully fix and get working that may throw bugs and errors.

This update is to let the wider tModloader community know Polarities is still alive, but bleeding and needs help. So please, if you encounter a bug or error, or something doesn't match with the 1.3 version please let us know either on this steampage or on the discord so that we can try and fix it next update. And if you know anyone who could help with coding and fixing these big issues and further porting, or you could do that, please reach out.

The 1.4.4 version of Polarities is currently in beta: Not all of the content from 1.3 has been ported yet!

A content mod which aims to add mechanically interesting bosses, enemies, items, and more! (Not all of this has been ported yet) Currently adds ten new bosses, several new enemies, a variety of weapons and accessories, some tiles and armor sets, two new mini-biomes, a new subworld, and a new town NPC.
